###Introduction
The purpose of this assignment is to explore data from a personal activity
monitoring device. The device collects step data every 5 minutes. This dataset 
contains data from October 2012 to November 2012. 

###Unzip and Read Dataset
After forking the RepData_PeerAssessment1 folder from Github, unzip ```activity.zip```, 
which contains the .csv file with the data. Make sure the working directory
is set to the forked repo.

```{r}
unzip("activity.zip") 
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

###Explore the Dataset
The first order of business is to explore the dataset. This can be done using 
```str```.

```{r}
str(activity)
```
